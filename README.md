# dwm

## [DISCLAIMER]

This is default dwm taken straight from suckless.org.
I did this so I could have stability and independence in my dwm build. This is achieved by hosting it on this repo so it will not be able to change without my confirmation.
My own customized dwm build is at (https://github.com/tuxfanboy/mydwm)

## Installation

Run "make clean install" as root in the dwm directory.
